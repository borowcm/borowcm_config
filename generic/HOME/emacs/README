* NOTE *: Read the INSTALL.EMACS file first!

Useful Keybindings:

C-x 2 : split buffer horizontally 

C-s : goto emacs shell. 

C-x o : switch to other buffer

C-c j : goto line

C-x b : show all buffers. type _any_ string of characters of the
        buffer you want to switch to and press Return.

Meta-/ : complete partial string. Very useful! Saves a lot of typing.

         eg: type first few characters of a word previously typed in
         one of your buffers. Keep pressing Meta-/ until it finds the
         word.  'Meta' key : On Sun keyboards, its the diamond
         symbol. On IBM PC keyboard, its the Alt key.
 
C-c u : show matching braces. 

C-c d : goto matching brace. 

Sample Usage of above commands:

      After editing a buffer(a C++ program), split the buffer
      horizontally (C-x 2) and go to the shell (C-s) to compile
      it. Switch to the program buffer (C-x o) or go to any other
      buffer which has the error (C-x b) to correct compilations
      errors. Go to the erroroneous line (C-c j).
       
C-c n : place the current line at top of the buffer. Useful in shell
        buffer, its like type "clear" in an xterm.

C-x spacebar : set mark

/**** Rectangle Commands  ****/
C-x r r : copy rectangle to register. First you have "set mark" (C-x
          spacebar) for coordinate (left,top) then move the cursor to
          the coordinate (right,bottom). Then type C-x r r to save the
          rectangle defined by the above coordinates to a
          register. 

C-x r d : delete rectangle 

C-x r i or C-x g : Will prompt you for a register and places its
                   contents.

Uses of Rectangle commands:

1. if you have 4 columns of results in a file but want to plot 2
   columns (X-Y/2D plot) at a time. Save 2 columns (C-x r r), open a 
   new buffer and paste the 2 columns (C-x r i/C-x g). Give the new 
   file as input to 'gnuplot'.

2. If you have a sequence of long commands to type. Type once and save each
   command to a register and retrieve. 

/**** Text Buffers ****/

C-x r x : copy buffer of text to a register. The contents can be retrieved
          with C-x g or C-x r i.

/**** Automatic Inserts  ****/

C-c P : Insert Perl header. Highly recommended. The first line invokes
        the perl interpreter.

C-c L : Insert a (default) Latex preamble and empty document body.

C-c H : Insert a #ifndef-#endif block. A must for C/C++ header files.

C-c C : Insert C++ Copyright header.

Programming Modes Commands
__________________________

Latex:

C-c c : Compile. Press spacebar for choice between calling Latex (run
        latex on file), View (view using xdvi), Print (to a printer),
        File (print to a PS file), Bibtex (calling bibtex). Check
        'latex-settings.el' for customizations.

Bibtex:

C-c o : Make alternate entries permanent by removing the "OPT" prefix.

You can use the emacs menu bar to select the entry type (conference
proceedings, journal article etc) or M-x bibtex-<spacebar> will give
you the list of entry types.

Misc Commands
_____________

M-x count-words-region/buffer: For region, set the mark then type this
			       command. Useful for papers with word
  			       limits.

ssh:

M-x ssh RET <machine_name> : ssh to a machine, usually to compile on
			     it.

NOTE: When prompted for a password, type C-c v then type your 
password. This will hide your password as you type it and send it to
the ssh process.

setnu:

M-x setnu: Its sometimes useful to see the lines numbers alongside
           your text like the ":set (no)nu" command in vi. Its a
           toggle function.


Abbrev Commands
_______________

If you want my list of cool abbreviations copy the following file:

cp ~rradhakr/.abbrev_defs ~

The abbreviations are only available when "Abbrev" mode is on.

C-c o : is a toggle function which switches on/off the "Abbrev" mode.
