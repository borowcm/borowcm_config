Basis Emacs Utilities

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maintaining Copyright Blocks

Command: basis-insert-std-copyright
     This command inserts the standard Basis copyright block at the current
     point in the buffer. It also inserts a Doxygen file comment block (and
     hence requires that `doxygen.el' be available.

Dealing with Guarded Include Files

Command: basis-insert-include-file filename
     This command prompts for a filename and inserts a guarded include
     directive including that file at the current point.

Command: basis-insert-include-file-guards
     This command inserts include guards around the line containing the
     point, if that point is on a line containing a #include directive.

Command: basis-insert-include-file-guards-in-region start end
     This command inserts include guards around all #include directives in
     the current region.

     basis-insert-include-file-guards-in-region does not check for already
     guarded directives. This is an important future direction.

Function: bt-guard-macro-from-filename filename
     bt-guard-macro-from-filename generates a guard macro name from
     filename, which must be string.

     (bt-guard-macro-from-filename "bt_types.h")
         => "__BT_TYPES_H__"

Constant: bt-include-directive-regexp
     This constant contains the regular expression used to detect #include
     directives. By default it recognizes local ("") and system (<>)
     includes. Filenames can contain any combination of capital and
     lower-case roman letters, numerals, period, or underscore, followed by
     ".h".
