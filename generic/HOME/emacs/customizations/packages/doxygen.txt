Doxygen Utilities

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating Function Comments

Command: doxygen-insert-comment
     doxygen-insert-comment inserts a full (Qt-style) comment block at
     point, placing the cursor after the brief comment line.

     //!
     /*!

     */

Command: doxygen-insert-function-comment
     doxygen-insert-function-comment inserts a full (Qt-style) comment block
     for the function whose declaration is on the line with point. The
     comment block includes \param lines for each function argument, and if
     the function has a return value, a \return line is also included. The
     cursor is placed after the brief comment line.

     For example, running doxygen-insert-function-comment on the function

     int add(int a, int b)
     {
         return a + b;
     }

     generates the comment block

     //!
     /*!
       <long-description>

       \param a
       \param b
       \return <ReturnValue>
     */

Command: doxygen-insert-member-group-region start end
     doxygen-insert-member-group-region adds the appropriate comments to
     make the current region a member group. For example, given a region
     containing

         foo = 1,
         bar,
         baz

     (part of an enum), doxygen-insert-member-group-region generates

     //@{
         foo = 1,
         bar,
         baz
     //@}

Command: doxygen-insert-compound-comment
     doxygen-insert-compound-comment inserts a right margin Doxygen
     "compound" comment (indented using the current mode's value of
     comment-column) on the current line. For example, using this command on
     the definition of foo in

     enum {
         foo = 1
     }

     yields

     enum {
         foo = 1                                  //!<
     };

     with the point immediately after the comment.

Creating File-level Comments

Command: doxygen-insert-file-comment
     doxygen-insert-file-comment inserts a comment-block containing
     information about the current file. The filename, author, and date are
     generated based on current values on the system.

     /*!
       \file   foo.c
       \brief

       <long description>

       \author Tom Emerson
       \date   2000-07-10
     */

User-Settable Options

User Option: doxygen-date-format
     doxygen-date-format is a format-time-string format string used to
     format dates used with the Doxygen \date directive.
